This is a [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8) template for creating a new [sbt-latex](https://github.com/emchristiansen/sbt-latex) project.

To use: 

1. Install [SBT](https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras) and [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8).
2. Create a new LaTeX project with the command `g8 emchristiansen/sbt-latex`.

Now you can move into the created directory and run `sbt latex` to build the example.
