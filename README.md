This is a [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8) template for creating a new [sbt-latex](https://github.com/emchristiansen/sbt-latex) project.
It generates a new sbt-latex project, including the build configuration and sample files, saving you a bit of time.

To use: 
  * Install [SBT](https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras) and [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8).
  * Create a new LaTeX project with the command `g8 emchristiansen/sbt-latex`.

Now you can move into the created directory and run `sbt latex` to build the example.

Trick: Run `~latex` from sbt to rebuild whenever a file changes.
