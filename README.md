This is a [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8) template for creating a new [SBTLatex project](https://github.com/emchristiansen/SBTLatex).

To use: 

1. Install SBT and g8.
1. Install SBTLatex locally (`publish-local`).
2. Create a new LaTeX project with the command `g8 emchristiansen/SBTLatexTemplate`.

Now you can move into the created directory and run `sbt latex` to build the example.
